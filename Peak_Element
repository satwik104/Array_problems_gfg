An element is called a peak element if its value is not smaller than the value of its adjacent elements(if they exists).
Given an array arr[] of size N, find the index of any one of its peak elements.
Note: The generated output will always be 1 if the index that you return is correct. Otherwise output will be 0. 

Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {1,2,3}
Output: 1
Explanation: index 2 is 3.
It is the peak element as it is 
greater than its neighbour 2.

******I have given the code of required function, you can find the driver code on gfg site**********
Code-
int peakElement(int arr[], int n)
{
     // check if first element is peak element
    if (n == 1 || arr[0] >= arr[1]) 
      return 0;
    // check if last element is peak element
    if (arr[n - 1] >= arr[n - 2])
        return n - 1;
     // check for every other element
    else
    {
        for(int i=1; i<n-1; i++)
   {
       if(arr[i]>arr[i-1] && arr[i]>arr[i+1])
       {
           return i;
       }
   }
    }
}
